# IAPT SMS and Email Libray

This is a library of SMS and email templates made for Northamptonshire IAPT.
The purpose is to save clincial staff from re-writing emails and text messsges sent frequently to patients. It also enables consistency in communication with patients - both in content and written English.

Users can add a patient name which is then included in the SMS or Email text generated below.
Users can toggle between an SMS and Email option, and the app updates colours and button presets when the toggle switch is moved.
